The Deep Below

Hello! This is a personal project by Luka Brown. 
I have a passion for creating games and right now this is one of my main side projects.


This game is a mining game with many planned cool features. 
Currently users can use WASD to move around the map of #'s to find objects that sometimes sparkle *.
There is a shop system to trade for ore, artifacts, coins, and upgrades.
There are also enemy miners in the game that move and can attack if provoked! 
Watch out for minibosses and a final boss too!
Enter t to get to the title screen to save or load.
