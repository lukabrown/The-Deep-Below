The Deep Below

Hello! This is a personal project by Luka Brown. I have a passion for creating games and right now this is one of my main side projects.


This game is a mining game with many planned cool features. Currently users can use WASD to move around the map of #'s to find objects that sometimes sparkle *.
There is a shop system to trade for ore, artifacts, coins, and upgrades! There are no enemies quite yet but feel free to explore around while the game is in 
peaceful mode. Soon there will be rogue miners unleashed in the map to create competiton among resources and map control. Watch out for minibosses and a final
boss also coming! Lastly, there is no save system currently so just push enter q in the main screen and the program will give you a final score.
